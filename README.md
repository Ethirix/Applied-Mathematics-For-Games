### Rendering
Good use of the sphere to illustrate object rendering
I would like to see multiple object types render to show pipeline state swapping
I appreciate some time has been spent on object orientation/memory management techniques here

### Lighting
Lighting calculations all look good so far
I'd recommend trying to implement texturing as this will enhance the look of the objects you have created
This can be expanded to Specular Mapping also as a simply enhancement 

Good progress on OO concepts, but the rendering does need more work to manage the upcoming tutorials
